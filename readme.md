Computer security for the lazy
==========================================
Shit you need to worry about (in order of importance):
* losing your files
* losing your accounts
* losing your privacy

Losing your files
-----------------
All your photos of family and friends. All your financial records. All your university homework. All that porn you've been stashing. The biggest computer security threat you'll ever have to worry about is losing them. Every hard drive is a ticking time bomb, just waiting to fail. You could accidentally leave your laptop in the back of a taxi and never see it again. Recently there has been a spate of attacks where criminals will gain remote access to your computer, encrypt everything on it, and then demand ransom payment to decrypt it. However it happens the results are the same - you've lost your shit.

Thankfully preventing these problems is easy; back your shit up. I use and recommend [Crashplan](http://www.crashplan.com/). More details coming soon.

Losing your accounts
--------------------
Your email. Your internet banking. Your Facebook, Twitter and World of Warcraft character. These are all "accounts" and you can lose them. If you choose a shitty password someone can just guess or "brute force" it. If you're tricked into installing malicious software it can log every keystroke you press, recording your passwords. If you are directed to a spoofed version of a trusted website and you try to log in, you've just given the bad guys your password. If you use the same password everywhere you're truly fucked.

Unfortunately there isn't a single easy solution to these threats. The best thing is having a well calibrated "bullshit" detector. Using a password manager and keeping your computer up to date with security patches will also help. Detailed section on all this coming soon.

Losing your privacy
-------------------
Take any private photos of you and your partner? Do you write a pseudonymous blog like "[Belle de Jour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_de_Jour_%28writer%29)" or at the other end of the sexual activity spectrum, "[Nice Jewish Girl](http://www.shomernegiah.blogspot.com/)"? Don't want someone going through the soppy love poems emailed to your partner? Want to complain about work to a friend over chat / IM without getting fired?

Remember that laptop you left in the back of a taxi? Someone could go through all the files on it. Browsing on an insecure wifi network could give you away to anyone within range. Depending on which country you live in, your ISP could be obliged to log your browsing history, where criminals will undoubtedly hack in and get access to it at some point.

The threat to privacy is a bit more esoteric than losing your files or accounts, because it isn't obvious when it happens. When you lose your hard drive, you know about it. When someone steals money out of your bank account, you know about it. When Facebook gathers information about the websites you visit and sells it to other companies, you're left in the dark.

I'll go through ways to keep your communication and browsing private, stay tuned.
